# Example: Process streamlining

## [Large Lots](https://largelots.org/)

>The Large Lot Program is a housing land use approach that was developed as part of the Green Healthy Neighborhoods public planning process. The program is being piloted in community areas where the City owns large amounts of vacant land. The core goals of the program are:

> - Give local residents greater control over vacant land in their neighborhood
> - Dispose of some of the City-owned land in these neighborhoods efficiently, which returns the land to the tax rolls
> - Create wealth in the community by allowing owners to sell land after five years
> - Increase safety, build community, and raise home values by creating more neighborhood-level investment

>LargeLots.org was built to make the process of purchasing City-owned land through this program easier for residents. It was initiated by Demond Drummer at Teamwork Englewood, built by DataMade, and funded by LISC Chicago with support from the Boeing Corporation, and the Knight Foundation for LISC's OpenGov for the Rest of Us project.

>On December 10, 2014, LargeLots.org was officially adopted by the City of Chicago as part of the Large Lot Program. See the passed ordinance.

## [Chicago CityKey](http://www.chicityclerk.com/chicagocitykey/)
[Video explaining design process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaOj3MJOXBw)

>In 2015, a task force was launched to bring together City officials and community groups to develop a program that looked at the barriers that many Chicagoans faced when trying to obtain government-issued ID.

>The CityKey is an optional, valid, government-issued photo identification card available to all Chicago residents regardless of a resident’s age, housing status, criminal record, immigration status, or gender identity.

>The CityKey serves as a four-in-one card by serving as a valid, government-issued ID card, your Chicago Public Library card, Ventra card and pharmaceutical discount card. Additionally, the CityKey provides cardholders with discounts to participating museums, theaters, sporting events, restaurants, and retail stores and businesses across Chicago.

>As part of the CityKey program, CityKey cardholders will be able to access a pharmaceutical discount through a pharmacy benefit management program called the Chicago Rx Card. The Chicago Rx Card will provide discounts on generic and name brand medications and is a free and easy way to save up to 80% on prescription drugs and also provides discounts on dental, vision, veterinarian, and lab and diabetes supplies/equipment.

### Example: Crowdsourcing

**[My Building Doesn't Recycle!](http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/)**

>My Building Doesn’t Recycle! is a web app that allows multi-unit renters (renters in buildings with 5 or more units) to report that they do not have recycling in their building. This site was created by Claire Micklin, Ben Wilhelm, and Alex Kahn at Open Government Hack Night.

### Example: Process streamlining

**[Large Lots](https://largelots.org/)**

>The Large Lot Program is a housing land use approach that was developed as part of the Green Healthy Neighborhoods public planning process. The program is being piloted in community areas where the City owns large amounts of vacant land. The core goals of the program are:

> - Give local residents greater control over vacant land in their neighborhood
> - Dispose of some of the City-owned land in these neighborhoods efficiently, which returns the land to the tax rolls
> - Create wealth in the community by allowing owners to sell land after five years
> - Increase safety, build community, and raise home values by creating more neighborhood-level investment

>LargeLots.org was built to make the process of purchasing City-owned land through this program easier for residents. It was initiated by Demond Drummer at Teamwork Englewood, built by DataMade, and funded by LISC Chicago with support from the Boeing Corporation, and the Knight Foundation for LISC's OpenGov for the Rest of Us project.

>On December 10, 2014, LargeLots.org was officially adopted by the City of Chicago as part of the Large Lot Program. See the passed ordinance.

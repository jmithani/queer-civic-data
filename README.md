# Queer Communities, Civic Tech, and Open Data 
How does open data and civic technology intersect with queer identities and concerns? How can civic tech enrich the LGBTQ+ life while respecting the privacy and vulnerability of queer populations? Which kinds of data can be exploited to help or harm queer people? What sort of guidelines could be put in place to prevent that from happening? We will discuss current open data sets, possible public data that could be released, and brainstorm civic technology projects to specifically address the concerns of the LGBTQ+ community. 

The goal of this session is threefold: start a conversation in the civic technology/open data space centered on queer experiences, proactively identify threats presented by open data, and to brainstorm possible open source projects to benefit LGBTQ+ communities around the world.

>One of the wonderful things about civic technology is that no one really knows what it means....[W]e can begin to identify four major intentions of civic apps: to inform, to persuade, to provide access, or to change the way our democracy works. These correspond to four genres of apps: news, propaganda, access, and system plumbing. Civic apps either promote communication or action. Additionally, civic apps are either “ends” or “means” apps. For “ends” apps, people using the app is the point. In “means” apps, people using the app is good if it helps achieve some other end.

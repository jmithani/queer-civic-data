# Queer Communities, Civic Tech, and Open Data 

**Find this page!! bit.ly/queercivicdata**

How does open data and civic technology intersect with queer identities and concerns? How can civic tech enrich the LGBTQ+ life while respecting the privacy and vulnerability of queer populations? Which kinds of data can be exploited to help or harm queer people? What sort of guidelines could be put in place to prevent that from happening? We will discuss current open data sets, possible public data that could be released, and brainstorm civic technology projects to specifically address the concerns of the LGBTQ+ community. 

The goal of this session is threefold: start a conversation in the civic technology/open data space centered on queer experiences, proactively identify threats presented by open data, and to brainstorm possible open source projects to benefit LGBTQ+ communities around the world. 

## Schedule
Part I: Situating Ourselves
- Introductions
- What is civic tech? What is open data?
- Civic tech design patterns 

Part II: Queer Data Dreams
- What data is available?
- What data do we wish were available?
- Precarity, what do we not want to be open?

Part III: Building What We Want 
- Breakout design groups
- Sharing with the group

## Part I: Situating Ourselves (15-20 minutes)
Introduce ourselves with our name, pronouns, and **what civic tech (or open data!) means to you.**

>One of the wonderful things about civic technology is that no one really knows what it means....[W]e can begin to identify four major intentions of civic apps: to inform, to persuade, to provide access, or to change the way our democracy works. These correspond to four genres of apps: news, propaganda, access, and system plumbing. Civic apps either promote communication or action. Additionally, civic apps are either “ends” or “means” apps. For “ends” apps, people using the app is the point. In “means” apps, people using the app is good if it helps achieve some other end.

Nonprofit [Code For America](https://codeforamerica.org) has put together a list of [Civic Tech Patterns](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-patterns)—and, just as important, Anti-Patterns. [Code For All](https://codeforall.org/) has made a crowd-sourced [Civic Patterns](http://civicpatterns.org/) wiki. 

Here are a patterns from those sites that are particularly important in designing civic apps for the LGBTQ+ community:
- **[Build with, not for.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/build-with-not-for/) When building technological solutions for a community, invite the community to participate actively in a manner of co-creation so as to ensure the right needs are being met.**
- [Don't reinvent the wheel.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/)
- [Don't only focus on the negative.](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-patterns#focus-on-the-negative)
- [Don't wait, scrape!](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/dont-wait-scrape/) Don't hang around waiting for governments to release open data if you can get what you need some other way (e.g. screen scraping). 
- [Keep the world informed.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/keep-the-world-informed/) Share your experiences with the world as you're building. Help the community learn from you so that you can learn from them. 
- [Measure the right things.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/measure-the-right-things/) Gauge your success by counting a metric. Website visitors is not a good metric. 
- [Make your design as simple as possible.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/as-simple-as-possible/)
- [Don't just make government score cards.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/no-score-card/) Make places that allow people to act on that information.

## Part II: Queer Data Dreams (10 minutes)
Break up into groups and discuss one of the bullet points below. 

- What sort of data to we have access to already, via crowdsourcing or open data sets?
- Who collected this data? Is it considered an accurate sample? Is it "complete"? How is authority struggled with and established?
- What sort of data should *not* be collected? Why? How is this determined?
- How can data on LGBTQ+ populations be weaponized? What barriers can be put in place to deter abuse?

## Part III: Building What We Want (30 minutes)
Sticky note time! Everyone take **three (?) minutes** to jot down ideas or issues to build an LGBTQ+-focused civic app around. We'll stick them on the wall, group in loose issue areas, then break up into groups to do a design excercise. Groups can also browse the civic patterns and examples linked above. We will reunite after **twelve to fifteen (?) minutes** to share our ideas with the group.

Your proposal should answer these questions:

- What does this app do?
- Why is it important? What need does it meet?
- Who is the audience for this app?
- Which civic pattern / question does it relate to? ("None" is acceptable, articulate the high-level approach instead)
- What data or information is needed for this app?
- What does success look like? What does failure look like?
- What are privacy concerns, and how will you deal with them?
- Which technologies are you proposing to use?
- (Optional) How long will it take to make a minimum viable product? How much labor is needed to reach that?

Stretch goal: initialize repositories for our open-source ideas!

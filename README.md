# Queer Communities, Civic Tech, and Open Data 
How does open data and civic technology intersect with queer identities and concerns? How can civic tech enrich the LGBTQ+ life while respecting the privacy and vulnerability of queer populations? Which kinds of data can be exploited to help or harm queer people? What sort of guidelines could be put in place to prevent that from happening? We will discuss current open data sets, possible public data that could be released, and brainstorm civic technology projects to specifically address the concerns of the LGBTQ+ community. 

The goal of this session is threefold: start a conversation in the civic technology/open data space centered on queer experiences, proactively identify threats presented by open data, and to brainstorm possible open source projects to benefit LGBTQ+ communities around the world. 

## Schedule
Part I: Situating Ourselves
- Introductions
- What is civic tech? What is open data?
- Civic tech design patterns 

Part II: Queer Data Dreams
- What data is available?
- What data do we wish were available?
- Precarity, what do we not want to be open?

Part III: Building What We Want 
- Breakout design groups
- Sharing with the group

## Part I: Situating Ourselves
Introduce ourselves with our name, pronouns, and **what civic tech (or open data!) means to you.**

>One of the wonderful things about civic technology is that no one really knows what it means....[W]e can begin to identify four major intentions of civic apps: to inform, to persuade, to provide access, or to change the way our democracy works. These correspond to four genres of apps: news, propaganda, access, and system plumbing. Civic apps either promote communication or action. Additionally, civic apps are either “ends” or “means” apps. For “ends” apps, people using the app is the point. In “means” apps, people using the app is good if it helps achieve some other end.

Nonprofit [Code For America](https://codeforamerica.org) has put together a list of [Civic Tech Patterns](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-patterns)—and, just as important, Anti-Patterns. [Code For All](https://codeforall.org/) has made a crowd-sourced [Civic Patterns](http://civicpatterns.org/) wiki. 

Here are a patterns from those sites that are particularly important in designing civic apps for the LGBTQ+ community:
- **[Build with, not for.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/build-with-not-for/) When building technological solutions for a community, invite the community to participate actively in a manner of co-creation so as to ensure the right needs are being met.**
- [Don't reinvent the wheel.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/)
- [Don't only focus on the negative.](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-patterns#focus-on-the-negative)
- [Don't wait, scrape!](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/dont-wait-scrape/) Don't hang around waiting for governments to release open data if you can get what you need some other way (e.g. screen scraping). 
- [Keep the world informed.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/keep-the-world-informed/) Share your experiences with the world as you're building. Help the community learn from you so that you can learn from them. 
- [Measure the right things.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/measure-the-right-things/) Gauge your success by counting a metric. Website visitors is not a good metric. 
- [Make your design as simple as possible.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/as-simple-as-possible/)
- [Don't just make government score cards.](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/no-score-card/). Make places that allow people to act on that information. 

### Example: Crowdsourcing

**[My Building Doesn't Recycle!](http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/)**

My Building Doesn’t Recycle! is a web app that allows multi-unit renters (renters in buildings with 5 or more units) to report that they do not have recycling in their building. This site was created by Claire Micklin, Ben Wilhelm, and Alex Kahn at Open Government Hack Night.

**[Refuge Restrooms](https://www.refugerestrooms.org/)**

>Refuge Restrooms is a web application that seeks to provide safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming individuals. Users can search for restrooms by proximity to a search location, add new restroom listings, as well as comment and rate existing listings.
>We’re trans led and seek to create a community focused not only on finding existing safe restroom access, but also advocating for transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming people’s safety.

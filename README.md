# Queer Communities, Civic Tech, and Open Data 
How does open data and civic technology intersect with queer identities and concerns? How can civic tech enrich the LGBTQ+ life while respecting the privacy and vulnerability of queer populations? Which kinds of data can be exploited to help or harm queer people? What sort of guidelines could be put in place to prevent that from happening? We will discuss current open data sets, possible public data that could be released, and brainstorm civic technology projects to specifically address the concerns of the LGBTQ+ community. 

The goal of this session is threefold: start a conversation in the civic technology/open data space centered on queer experiences, proactively identify threats presented by open data, and to brainstorm possible open source projects to benefit LGBTQ+ communities around the world.
